Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent? 
My class represents Alice from the book Alice in Wonderland. She can drink magic potions and eat magic cookies to grow and shrink, rest to regain energy, and move around to different points in wonderland. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I made a couple getter functions in order to track inventory, energy remaining, and location.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Planning out what your methods will accomplish beforehand. A lot of the return types messed me up a little bit, and made it difficult to fit the methods in to your plan for them.
